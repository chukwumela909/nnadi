    fullDescription: `This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of computer algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in considerable depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study.

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

This book is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in algorithms or data structures. Because it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design, as well as mathematical aspects, it is equally well suited for self-study by technical professionals.`,

    fullDescription: `Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way.

Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code "on the fly" into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmerâ€”but only if you work at it.`,

    fullDescription: `AI is transforming multiple industries. But building a machine learning system requires that you make practical decisions:

Should you collect more training data? Should you use end-to-end deep learning? Should you add more hand-designed features? Should you add more layers to your neural network? Sweeping changes in AI are making technical tactics obsolete almost as quickly as they are published. But the fundamentals of how to approach a machine learning project are more stable.

This book is structured to teach you how to make the decisions that lead to success. Although some of the material is fairly technical, you don't need a deep background in machine learning to understand it.`,
